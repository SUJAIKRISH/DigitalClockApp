# DigitalClockUsingCpp
This project aims to provide a clear and concise example of how to create a functional digital clock using fundamental C++ concepts, making it a valuable resource for beginners in programming.

# Digital Clock Using C++

This project demonstrates the creation of a digital clock using the C++ programming language. The digital clock is implemented in a console application and utilizes several C++ libraries, including `stdio.h`, `conio.h`, `time.h`, `graphics.h`, and `stdlib.h`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the digital clock application, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Additionally, the project relies on specific C++ libraries, so ensure that they are available on your system as well.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Kunal-kawate/DigitalClockUsingCpp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Digital-Clock-Using-CPP
   ```

3. Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:

   ```
   g++ digital_clock.cpp -o digital_clock
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```
   ./digital_clock
   ```

## Usage

Once you run the application, you will see a real-time digital clock displayed in the console. The clock will continuously update to show the current time.
